summary: Get the required metadata keys.
description: |
  This method returns an array list with the metadata keys that a service must
  have in its metadata in order to be processed by the Adaptor.<br/><br/>

  **All** elements inside the array are required and must be present in a
  service metadata at the same time -- **AND** operand-- otherwise it is
  considered invalid.<br/><br/>

  An empty list is to be interpreted as a misconfiguration on the Adaptor side.
