summary: Revert changes for a service.
description: |
  `DELETE /services/{name}` tries to revert modifications applied for the
  service defined inside `{name}`.<br/><br/>

  As with `POST /services` and `PUT /services/{name}` this operation may
  take a while to complete, so the Adaptor will return a `202 ACCEPTED` rather
  than a `200 OK`.
